# Ribbon operators in topologically ordered quantum systems

Many interesting models are thought to exhibit topological order,
including the Toric code phase, the fractional quantum Hall effect[1]
and the antiferromagnet on the Kagome lattice[2,3]. Understanding
these models away from exactly solvable points has proven challenging.

The Toric code has a pair of logical opeators, corresponding to
topologically nontrivial strings of operators. Here, we present a
numerical algorithm for finding ribbon operators; the analogue of 
the strings in non-exactly solvable models. The algorithm utilises 
tensor network techniques to construct these extended operators 
without requiring any understanding of the ground state space of the 
Hamiltonian in question.
